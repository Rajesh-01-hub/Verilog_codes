<h1>HDL(hardware descriptive language)- Verilog </h1>

 ### WHY SHOULD WE LEARN HDL (Hardware Description Language)?

! HDL (Hardware Description Language) is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of an electronic / hardware system.
! It allows concurrent execution, meaning multiple operations run at the same time — just like real hardware.
! The most popular HDLs are:

->Verilog

->SystemVerilog

->VHDL

### ⚙️ LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION IN VERILOG**

Understanding the levels of abstraction helps you design, simulate, and visualize circuits through code.
Each level gives you a different way to represent hardware.

### Abstration levels 
| **Level**            | **Description**                                    | **Example**                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Switch Level**     | Describes hardware using transistor-level modeling | Example: `nmos`, `pmos`          |
| **Gate Level**       | Describes circuits using logic gates               | Example: AND, OR, NOT            |
| **Dataflow Level**   | Describes how data moves between signals           | Example: `assign Y = A & B;`     |
| **Behavioral Level** | Describes system behavior using procedural blocks  | Example: `always @(posedge clk)` |
### WHY ABSTRACTION FLOW MATTERS

If you understand the flow of abstraction through Verilog,
you will understand the actual meaning of your Verilog codes —
from logic gates to behavioral models — along with testbenches.

->>**This skill is what separates a coder from a true digital design engineer.**<<-

### IN SHORT
<h3>Verilog + SystemVerilog + Testbenches = Digital Design & Verification Career Success!</h3>
