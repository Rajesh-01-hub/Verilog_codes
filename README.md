# Verilog_codes
why should we learn HDL(hardware discription langauge) ?
A: ->it is a specilized computer langauge
   -> it is used to describe the structure and behaviour of electronic system / hardware system.
   ->basically, it is concurrency, mean to say excuite at a same time.
   Verilog , System verilog and VHDL are using for hardware description
level of abstractions are the most important for verilog . we should know the level of abstractions allows to design circuits by using code.
    -> switch levle abstraction
    -> gate level abstration
    -> dataflow level abstration
    -> behaviour level abstration
if we understand the flow of level abstraction through by using verilog, you will understand the actual meaning of verilog codes along with test bech.

lost think but not the least completing verilog, system verilog through testbeches , you will select for those job roles : digital design and DV(design verification).
