**NOTICES->>**
<span style="color:red">**(The requirement to use only 2-to-1 multiplexers exists because the original exam question also wanted to test logic function simplification using K-maps and how to synthesize logic functions using only multiplexers. If you wish to treat this as purely a Verilog exercise, you may ignore this constraint and write the module any way you wish.)**</span>
